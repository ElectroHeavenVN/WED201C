# Peer-graded Assignment: JavaScript Interactive Photo Gallery
## Instructions
In this assignment you will use the code that I provide in order to create an interactive photo gallery. The goal is to gain practice with writing JavaScript code to update elements of the DOM. You will fill in the code for two functions â€“ one to respond to when a mouse is over an image, and the other to respond to when the mouse leaves an image. 

Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to see how your peer's code may differ from yours, while still achieving the same objectives.

### Grading Criteria Overview
Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer who will check the functionality of your JavaScript.

### Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions
1. Start by getting your own version of the code. You can either download the file and save it as a javascript file or use the CodePen example as a start for your own.
2. Review the HTML and find the ids and classes of the elements you want to listen to and/or change.
3. Begin by filling in the code for the function upDate.
   - I highly recommend beginning with a console.log() to check that your event is triggering.
   - I would then recommend that you use console.log to print out some information about the previewPic variable, specifically the alt and source
   - Use document.querySelector or document.getElementById to change the text of the element with the id of image.
   - Check your work.
   - Use document.querySelector or document.getElementById to change the background image of the element with the id of image.
   - Check your work. If it isn't working, use console.log to doublecheck the values you are using.
4. Fill in the code for the undo function.
   - Update the url for the background image of the div with the id of image back to the original value of background-image: url('').
   - Update the text of the div with the id of image back to the original text of "Hover over an image below to display here."
5. Host and share your site - using either CodePen or a hosting site of your choosing.
6. Complete your peer reviews

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Are we grading on the attractiveness of a site?**

No.

**When peer grading how can I see the code?**

Click on the link that they provide. If you get a 404 error then they will need to submit a new valid link. If you see the page (but not the code) you can do a Right Click on the page and then View Page Source.
