# Portfolio Requirements
At long last you can stop styling sites based on my content and layout and get to something that you have a personal interest in. While the content of your site is **COMPLETELY UP TO YOU**, there will be requirements on the structure.

### Requirements
Each portfolio must **have at least three "pages"**. These can be three different html files, or one file that links to all three "pages." Here is an example:
- Single file: Clicking on the navigation links will take you to a specific section in a page. https://cvanlent.github.io/
- Multiple files: Clicking on the navigation links will take you to a different file https://intro-webdesign.com/v3

As you make your choice, think about any accessibility issues that may come along with your implementation. You will not have time to make a "perfect" site (no one ever does), but I am concerned with you making informed decisions.

### Additional requirements
- Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)
- Each page must validate at [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least three unique views
- You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages
  - If this requirement doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that fulfills it. You can always unlink it after you have been peer-graded.
- Each page must be styled
  - The goal is not to impress, but to show competence. So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
