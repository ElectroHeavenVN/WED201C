# Portfolio Grading Rubric
I hope that people will be more concerned with their learning than their grade on this assignment. But I understand that people want to make sure they receive full credit so I will provide the grading rubric that will be used. Feel free to structure your page around it.

There are 5 main areas for evaluation:

  - **Does the site validate?**
  - **Is the site responsive?**
  - **Is the site well-styled?** This is very objective. It should be difficult to score a high score, but not difficult to receive the majority of the points. It is important that everyone create a unique style sheet, even if using a template or framework. Look for feedback in Week Five to improve your score.
  - **Are the images incorporated effectively?**
  - **Did you successfully demonstrate the ability to enhance your site?** You need to add four elements to your site that are unique – something beyond what we did in the four previous courses. You are encouraged to be as creative as you would like (and creative does not need to mean time-intensive). Some options for these "extras" include:
    + Add custom JavaScript (e.g. incorporate dynamic content, use JS to perform verification, modify the DOM)
    + Enhance the accessibility of your page (e.g. put your site through the some subset of the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/evalquickref/) quick evaluation reference)
    + Incorporate plugins (e.g. Google Calendar, a map, parallax, etc.) You will need to show what you did other than just copying code. Did you need to change any of the attributes? Change any of the links?
    + Include a Carousel for your images (don't forget to turn off the automatic start feature if you can!!)
    + Use a sticky footer to create a consistent look across different browser heights (we usually only consider widths…)
    + Add a third viewport layout (e.g. a table view that is different than mobile or large-screen) 

Again, these are just suggestions, please feel free to let your own creativity be your guide. **Don't let this course ruin your life!! As a six week course it is expected that you will spend a total of 36-48 hours total on your work. Code smart.**

| Fully validates (warnings are fine)                                                                                           | 20    |
| There are errors, but the student has shown (in their write-up or video) that they are caused by plugins and can not be fixed | 16    |
| There are at most 3 errors for the entire site                                                                                | 12    |
| They have only shown that part of the site validates (For instance, only tested one of the files in a multi-file site.)       | 6     |
| More than three errors were left or the site was not tested at all                                                            | 0     |
