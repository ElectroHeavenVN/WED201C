# Peer-graded Assignment: Create a Responsive Stylesheet
## Instructions
The goal of the final project is to create a responsive website that has three distinct views - mobile, tablet, and large screens. By changing the display and width of elements you will change the layout from one horizontal div, to two horizontal divs, to three horizontal divs. By adding media queries you can have these changes trigger automatically at different viewport sizes. 

The mobile view is provided for you [as a zip file](https://intro-webdesign.com/v3/responsive_repo/week2/responsiveHomework.zip).

You will need to edit the style.css file to add two media queries.
1. **Query #1 will trigger at 772px and act as your "Tablet View"**
   - Change the page layout so that divs are 45% of viewport width and images are no more 30% of viewport height. 
   - (You will need to change more than just the width to achieve the change to the divsâ€¦)
2. **Query #2 will trigger at 998px and act as your "Large Screen View"**
   - Change the page layout so that divs are 30% of viewport width.
   - No other changes are needed.

Your peer review is normally a great chance to see if others wrote their code differently, but in this case most of the code will be very similar. Don't worry, the next assignment will have more creativity!

### Grading Criteria Overview
Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer. Your peers will check that you changed the necessary properties to recreate the two looks. 

### Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Are we grading on the attractiveness or originality of a site?**

No. Every submission should match the example. 

**When peer grading how can I see the code?**

Click on the link that they provide. If you get a 404 error then they will need to submit a new valid link. If you see the page (but not the code) you can do a Right Click on the page and then View Page Source.

**The student is failing because they only made one or two small mistakes. Should I grade more leniently?**

Not in this assignment. There are only a few steps and we want to make sure everyone can do basic media queries before they move on to advanced. Feel free to let your peers know exactly what they are doing wrong.
