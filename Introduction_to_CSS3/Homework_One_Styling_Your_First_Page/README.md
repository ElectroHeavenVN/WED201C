# Peer-graded Assignment: Homework One: Styling Your First Page
## Instructions
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice styling a pre-existing website. You will link the provided html files to a single css file that you will create yourself. Your job is to create CSS rules to add colors, modify the different fonts, and change the spacing and layout of elements on the page. While creating your style, make sure to run the page through the Wave validator to check for color contrast errors.

When you are done you will host your site and then complete peer reviews. The reviews not only provide feedback for your peers, but are a great way for you to see how CSS can generate such different looks for identical HTML code.

### Grading Criteria Overview
Your project will be graded by the careful examination of your code by a peer as well as the [W3C Markup Validation Service Tool](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). Your peers will look for syntactically correct CSS rules. Did you include the selectors, properties, and values? Did you check your site for color contrast issues? Did you link the CSS file correctly in all three HTML pages?

### Instructions
Steps:
1. Fork the code from this replit site: https://replit.com/@WD4E-CSS/ProjectStarter
2. Create a single stylesheet for all three pages.
3. Write a CSS rule to style the body tag to modify the font family and font size properties.
4. Write a CSS rule to style the header tag to modify the background color property.
5. Write a CSS rule to style the nav tag to modify the background color property.
6. Write a CSS rule to style the main tag to modify the background color and font size property
7. Write a CSS rule to style the footer tag to modify the background color property.
8. Write a CSS rule to style the li tag to modify the display and width properties.
9. Write a CSS rule to style the h1 tag to modify the text alignment, font family, and color properties.
10. Write a CSS rule to style the p tag to modify the line height property.
11. Validate your code using https://wave.webaim.org/ or the wave browser extension.
12. Submit your link.
13. Complete your peer reviews.

Steps 3 - 10 above are the minimum changes for the tags â€“ you can add additional style! With the exception of the display value and width of the list items we are not looking for any specific values.

### Examples of Good Feedback
Issues detected by your peer in the code review.
- The css file is not linked correctly
- You are missing a semicolon in one of your rules
- You forget opening or closing brackets in one of your rules
- You have a typo in a selector
- You have an invalid property name (usually from a typo).
- You have an invalid property value (usually from a typo).

Issues detected by a validator and reported to you by your peer.
- Wave detected that you have a color contrast error.

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Are we grading on the attractiveness of a site?**

No. This is an early assignment and we are only looking for the ability to connect the style sheet and write basic CSS rules. As long as the style fulfills the requirements above and passes the Wave validator, give full credit. 

**When peer grading how can I see the code?**

Click on the link that they provide. If you get a 404 error then they will need to submit a new valid link. If you see the page (but not the code) you can do a Right Click on the page and then View Page Source.

**Are warnings allowed in the validators?**

Do not deduct for validator warnings, just for errors.
